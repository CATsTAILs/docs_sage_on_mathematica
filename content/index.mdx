A subproject of Knot-Diagram project (temporary title!).

This project begins to use _Prime decomposition_ algorithms in many famous mathematical programs: __Maple__, __Magma__ and __Singular__ etc.

The documentation is intended to tell you how to use our API.

You can write mathematica formulae by _katex_ plugin. For example, $x^2-2$. Or:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
M & 0 \\ \lambda & \frac{1}{M}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
